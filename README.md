## üìÉ How User Data is Stored (LocalStorage)

- When a user signs up, their credentials are stored in `localStorage` in JSON format.
- Example:

```json
{
  "username": "Siddhesh01",
  "email": "sid@example.com",
  "password": "Sid@1234"
}
```

- Login checks these credentials against the stored data.
- No backend or database is required.
