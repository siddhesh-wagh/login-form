## Steps to Run HTML and CSS Files in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Follow the steps below to set up and run your HTML and CSS files locally using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) installed on your system.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. Visit the official [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Download and install VS Code for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions for your specific platform.

### Step 2: Install the 'Live Server' Extension in VS Code

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions** tab on the left sidebar, or press `Ctrl + Shift + X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + X` (macOS).
3. In the search bar, type `Live Server`.
4. Click on the extension named **Live Server** by **Ritwick Dey** and press the `Install` button.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository (If Applicable)

1. Open a terminal in your system (or use the terminal inside VS Code).
2. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
3. After cloning, navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

### Step 4: Open the Project Folder in VS Code

1. Launch **VS Code**.
2. Click on **File** > **Open Folder** (or `File > Open` for macOS) and select the project folder containing your HTML and CSS files.
3. Alternatively, you can use the terminal to open the folder by typing:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
   This will open the current folder in VS Code.

### Step 5: Open HTML File in VS Code

1. In the **Explorer** panel on the left (you can open it with `Ctrl + Shift + E`), locate the `.html` file you want to open.
2. Click on the HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) to open it in the editor.

### Step 6: Run the HTML File using Live Server

1. Right-click anywhere inside the opened HTML file.
2. From the context menu, select **Open with Live Server**.
   
   Alternatively, you can click on the **Go Live** button in the status bar at the bottom-right corner of the window.
   
3. A new browser tab will open, and you will see your HTML and CSS rendered in the browser. Any changes you make to the HTML or CSS will be automatically reflected in the browser as long as Live Server is running.

### Step 7: Stopping the Live Server

1. To stop the Live Server, click on the **Port: 5500** (or similar) button in the bottom-right corner of VS Code and click **Stop Server**.
2. Alternatively, you can close the terminal window in VS Code.

### Optional: View HTML without Live Server

If you prefer not to use the Live Server extension, you can open your HTML file directly in a browser:

1. Navigate to the folder where your HTML file is stored.
2. Double-click the `.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
   
   > Note: Live Server is recommended as it provides automatic reloads when you make changes.

### Troubleshooting

- If the Live Server doesn't automatically open your file, ensure that:
  - The **Live Server** extension is installed correctly.
  - Your default browser is set.
  - The HTML file is saved properly.
  
  You can also try restarting VS Code or reloading the window by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and selecting **Reload Window**.
